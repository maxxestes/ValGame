# ValGame
UE4 project used to recreate mechanics from VALORANT. Side project to help learn and practice gameplay programming with Unreal. Done almost completely in C++
with some blueprint creation to imitate industry flow. Beginning work for networking (needs A LOT of refactoring due to no inital plans for multiplayer).

Current additions:  

Similar recoil system.  
Gun C++ class that allows any possible gun to be made as a blueprint off of it.  
pick up / Gun management system (primary, secondary, knife, ammo system, etc.)  
Similar movement with air strafing, walking, crouching, etc.  
Full Ascent map to scale  
Interactable/distructable doors and switches similar to Ascent  
Sage wall ability with exact same properties as Valorant except for free rotation (has 90 degree) and lower health while forming.  
Jett smoke with homing when held and free fall when not functionality.
